# Intuition
- words in natural images often possess irregular shapes   <br>
&#8594; rectifying images would facilitate the task for the text recognizer

# Model Structure
1. Spatial Transformer Network(STN)
2. Sequence Recognition Network(SRN)

</p>

# STN
- performs Thin-Plate-Spline(TPS) transformation to rectify the input image

## Localization & Grid Generator
- localizes even number, denoeted by K, of fiducial points using CNN
- fiducial points are needed in order to find mapping before the original image and the rectified image
- another K (base fiducial points) 
- fiducial points are placed on top and below of the text

# SRN
